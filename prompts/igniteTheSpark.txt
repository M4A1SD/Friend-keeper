You have access to a detailed mind map about a friend, which contains:

- A short biography (`friend_bio`)
- A history of past encounters (`friend_entries`)
- The most recent encounter (`friend_latest_entry`), which is the most up-to-date information

Your task:

1. **Generate 10 personalized conversation starter questions.**  
   - Each question should clearly reference details from the most recent encounter (`friend_latest_entry`). 6 from the friend_latest_entry and 4 from the friend_entries.
   - Show genuine care and interest in this friend's life.  
   - Format each question as an object with the keys:
     ```json
     {
       "based_on": "<the specific detail/fact from friend_latest_entry>",
       "main_idea": "<short reason or approach>",
       "question": "<the actual question text>"
     }
     ```

2. **Generate 10 meetup ideas to help reconnect.**  
   - These ideas should be tailored to the friend's hobbies or interests (from `friend_bio`, `friend_entries`, `friend_latest_entry`).  
   - Focus on having a meaningful catch-up or conversation.  
   - Exclude online video games (LAN gaming is fine).  
   - If there's not enough info, include general default meetup ideas for men in their 20s, such as going to a bar, an escape room, or a trip to the beach, camping, hiking, road trips, a workout session, LAN gaming, paintball, razor trip, clubbing, rock climbing, water sports, water parks, cooking together, etc.  
   - Avoid local events or local clubs.  
   - Format each idea as an object with the keys:
     ```json
     {
       "idea": "<short name of the meetup idea>",
       "location": "<proposed place for the meetup>",
       "proposal": "<invite message or short pitch>"
     }
     ```

3. **Return a valid JSON object** with the following structure:

```json
{
  "conversation_questions": [
    {
      "based_on": "some specific detail from friend_latest_entry",
      "main_idea": "short descriptor of your approach",
      "question": "the actual question text"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "meetup_ideas": [
    {
      "idea": "short meetup idea name",
      "location": "the place for the meetup",
      "proposal": "the invitation message"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
