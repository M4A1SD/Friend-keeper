A short biography (friend_bio)

A history of past encounters (friend_entries)

Your task:

Generate 5 to 10 personalized conversation starter questions. Each question should:

Clearly reference small details from the most recent encounter.

Generate 5 to 10 meetup ideas to help reconnect. These ideas should:

Be tailored to the friend's hobbies or interests (friend_bio, friend_entries, friend_latest_entry).

Focus on having a meaningful catch-up or conversation.

If there's not enough info, include general meetup ideas for men in their 20s, such as going to a bar, an escape room, or a trip to the beach, camping, hiking, road trips, a workout session, or LAN gaming, paintball, razr trip, clubbing.

Must include a place or location for the meetup.

Avoid local clubs or local events.
