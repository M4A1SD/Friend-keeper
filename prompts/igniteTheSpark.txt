You have access to a detailed mind map about a friend, which contains:

A short biography (friend_bio)

A history of past encounters (friend_entries)

The most recent encounter (friend_latest_entry), which is the most up-to-date information

Your task:

Generate 5 to 10 personalized conversation starter questions. Each question should:

Clearly reference small details from the most recent encounter(friend_latest_entry).

Show genuine care and interest in this friend's life.

Generate 5 to 10 meetup ideas to help reconnect. These ideas should:

Be tailored to the friend's hobbies or interests (friend_bio, friend_entries, friend_latest_entry).

Focus on having a meaningful catch-up or conversation.

Exclude online video games (LAN gaming is fine).

If there's not enough info, include general default meetup ideas for men in their 20s, such as going to a bar, an escape room, or a trip to the beach, camping, hiking, road trips, a workout session, LAN gaming, paintball, razr trip, clubbing, rock climbing, water sports, water parks, cooking together, etc.

The idea must also include a place or location for the meetup.

Avoid local events or local clubs, as it's hard to time and we dont want to be dependable on local events.

Return a valid JSON object with this format:

{
"conversation_questions": [
"Question 1",
...
],
"meetup_ideas": [
"Idea 1",
...
]
}

Ensure the JSON is well-formed and each list has the requested 5â€“10 items.
